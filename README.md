#My UT99 Mods
So this is where I keep my UT99 mods, RipperArena and MessyKitty, now. Thanks must go to u/1337GameDev on Reddit for reminding me that GitHub exists.

#How To Install
For RipperArena and MessyKitty, put all files from the archives in your Unreal Tournament installation's System directory. For CTF-IrregularSpace, put the archived file(s) in your Unreal Tournament installation's Maps directory.
